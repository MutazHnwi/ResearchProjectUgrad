# Summer Undergrad Students In-Class Task

Welcome to your summer undergraduate program! In this in-class task, you'll get hands-on experience with web development by working with different files within a project. Let's dive in:

## Files Overview:

### 1. index.html
This is where your journey begins. The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point for your web application. Here, you'll find the structure of your web page, including HTML tags for defining the layout, content, and other elements.

### 2. phase1.js
The `phase1.js` file is part of the initial setup. You won't need to make any changes to this file. It may contain pre-existing code that sets up the foundational functionality or behavior of the web tool.

### 3. phase2.js
Here's where the fun begins! The `phase2.js` file is where you'll implement your own feature for the web tool. This is your opportunity to get creative and apply what you've learned.

## Getting Started:

1. **Open `index.html`:** Start by opening the `index.html` file in your preferred browser or run it in **live server**. This is where you'll find the basic structure of your web page. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the layout of the page.

2. **Explore `phase2.js`:** This is where you'll be spending most of your time. Open the `phase2.js` file and start brainstorming ideas for your feature. Think about what you want to accomplish and how you'll go about implementing it. Don't hesitate to refer to any documentation or resources you need along the way.

3. **Start Coding:** Once you have a clear plan in mind, start coding! Use your knowledge of JavaScript to bring your feature to life. Remember to test your code regularly to ensure everything is working as expected.

4. **Test and Iterate:** After implementing your feature, take some time to test it thoroughly. Check for any bugs or issues and make any necessary adjustments. Don't be afraid to iterate on your design and code to improve the overall quality of your feature.

5. **Celebrate Your Success:** Once you're satisfied with your work, pat yourself on the back! You've successfully completed your summer undergraduate in-class task.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
